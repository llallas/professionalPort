    <p>
      Hello, I'm Elias — a passionate technology enthusiast with a strong drive
      to create meaningful, user-focused solutions that make a positive impact.
      I thrive on curiosity and take a proactive approach to learning,
      problem-solving, and adapting to new challenges in the ever-evolving world
      of technology.<br />
      Currently, I am pursuing a Full-Stack Developer program at Indiana
      University Indianapolis, where I am honing my skills in both front-end and
      back-end development. This program has not only deepened my technical
      knowledge but also reinforced the importance of collaboration, creativity,
      and continuous growth in building effective digital experiences.<br />
      Whether it’s crafting intuitive user interfaces or architecting robust
      backend systems, I’m motivated by the opportunity to contribute to
      innovative projects that solve real-world problems. I enjoy exploring new
      tools, frameworks, and ideas, and I’m always looking for opportunities to
      apply what I’ve learned to help others and grow as a developer.
