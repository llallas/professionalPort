            Hello, I'm Elias — a passionate technology enthusiast with a strong
            drive to create meaningful, user-focused solutions that make a
            positive impact. I thrive on curiosity and take a proactive approach
            to learning, problem-solving, and adapting to new challenges in the
            ever-evolving world of technology.<br />
            Currently, I am pursuing a Full-Stack Developer program at Indiana
            University Indianapolis, where I am honing my skills in both
            front-end and back-end development. This program has not only
            deepened my technical knowledge but also reinforced the importance
            of collaboration, creativity, and continuous growth in building
            effective digital experiences.<br />
            Whether it’s crafting intuitive user interfaces or architecting
            robust backend systems, I’m motivated by the opportunity to
            contribute to innovative projects that solve real-world problems. I
            enjoy exploring new tools, frameworks, and ideas, and I’m always
            looking for opportunities to apply what I’ve learned to help others
            and grow as a developer.
